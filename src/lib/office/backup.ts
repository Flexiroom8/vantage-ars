/**
 * Office backup envelope. Tables are plain row arrays; a SHA-256 over the stable
 * JSON of the tables lets a restore tool (or you) detect a damaged or edited file.
 * Auth tables (user, session, account, verification) are deliberately never exported.
 *
 * `quote_links` is included: without it a restore silently kills every customer
 * quote link that is still open, and those customers can never answer.
 * `rate_hits` is excluded — it is transient throttling state with no business value.
 *
 * The manifest also carries the tables the office grew after the manifest was
 * first written, because a manifest without them drops real business records on
 * every restore:
 *
 *   - `delegations` and `delegation_usage` — the founder's standing authority,
 *     and every action taken under it. Without them a restored office has no
 *     delegation and no memory of what it did under one.
 *   - `subscriptions`, `billing_cycles` and `customer_notices` — the recurring
 *     revenue book, the billing ledger, and the record of what the office said
 *     to a customer. Without them a restored office has no recurring revenue
 *     and cannot tell a customer what it already sent them.
 *   - `decision_episodes`, `gate_records` and `decision_receipts` — the
 *     governance record. These arrive with the governance migration, so an
 *     office that has not migrated yet does not have them: they are listed as
 *     OPTIONAL, and both the export and the restore skip a table this office
 *     does not have instead of failing.

 * Tables that this office may not have yet.
 *

 * deployment on the day it is written. They belong in the manifest — a backup
 * without them drops the governance record — but their ABSENCE must never
 * break a backup or a restore, or an office that has not migrated yet could not
 * back itself up at all.
