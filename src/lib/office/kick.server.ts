/**
 * The opportunistic nudge.
 *
 * The office advertises a ten-minute cadence, but its two free triggers are
 * not reliable at that cadence: GitHub's scheduled workflows throttle
 * frequent cron runs on low-traffic repositories (gaps of hours were observed
 * in production), and Vercel's daily cron is only a floor. So any public surface
 * that already knows the office is alive — a health poll, a real page-view
 * beacon — is also a chance to catch up: if the last tick is older than
 * `KICK_AFTER_MINUTES`, this starts one.
 *
 * The nudge adds no new powers. It is gated on `AUTONOMY=on`, respects the
 * circuit breaker, and runs the exact tick the timer runs, with every one of
 * its guards: halt, database health, chain verification, dedupe keys and
 * atomic claims. The caller decides only how long it waits; the tick finishes
 * on the server regardless, and the next surface hit retries if a frozen
 * instance cut it short.
