/**
 * The scheduled autonomous run.
 *
 * Authenticated by `CRON_SECRET` as a bearer token (Vercel sends it
 * automatically), because a scheduler has no session cookie. Requires
 * `AUTONOMY=on` — the office does nothing unattended unless the founder turns
 * it on deliberately.
 *
 * Safety properties, all enforced in `runOfficeCron` rather than here:
 *   - the office halts on its own if the audit chain fails;
 *   - a circuit breaker stops the scheduler after repeated failing ticks;
 *   - every action still passes through the constitutional governor, so cost,
 *     customer wins and customer losses reach the founder for approval;
 *   - nothing is emailed to a customer from this route. Letters are drafted.
 *
 * The heavy lifting lives in `runOfficeCron` (a server function, where
 * `.server` imports are allowed); this file only adapts HTTP to that call so the
 * client-bundle import protection stays satisfied.
